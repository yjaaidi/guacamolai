# ðŸ¥‘ GuacamolAI

Turn your dev advocacy activity into a smooth, shareable spread on advocu.com.

## Chop & Mix

1. Download and install the latest version from https://github.com/yjaaidi/guacamolai/releases (For help on loading an unpacked extension, see https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked)
2. Click on the extension and configure it (once) with:
   - your name â€” this is used to pick your activity from pages that present the activity of multiple people
   - your Gemini API key â€” this is used to scrap the page
3. On the activities page, you should see a `URL to scrap` input. Put the URL there and submit.

## Limitations

No support for GitHub & YouTube activity yet.

## F.A.Q.

### Why is it opening a new tab?

The activity is opened a new tab to scrap pages that you need to be signed in to see such as meetup.com.

### Why not an MCP?

An integration with https://browsermcp.io/ could be a good idea, but how fast would that be?
